I'm a full-stack ${subject} teacher and designer with a passion for building ‚ú®beautiful‚ú® things from scratch. I've been building websites and apps since 2007 and also have a Master's degree in Engineering.

It was in college where I first discovered my ‚ù§Ô∏è for teaching and helping others by sharing all I knew. And that passionüî•üî• brought me to [NearAcademy] in 2015, where my students love the fact that I take the time to explain important concepts in a way that everyone can easily understand.

üîé Do you want to learn how to build awesome websites with advanced HTML and CSS?
üîé Looking for a complete JavaScript course that takes you from beginner to advanced developer?
üîé Or maybe you want to build modern and fast back-end applications with Node.js?

Then don't waste your üï§ with random tutorials or incomplete videos. All my courses are easy-to-follow, all-in-one packages that will take your skills to the next level.

These courses are exactly the courses I wish I had when I was first getting into web development!

So see for yourself, üì£enroll in one of my coursesüí¶ (or all of them :D) and join my [500,000+ happy students] today.`;
