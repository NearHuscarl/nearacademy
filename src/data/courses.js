	courseDescription: `This course is designed to help you [master the biology portion] of the new national exam through [biology hacks] and [biology fundamentals]. The hardest part of the biology national exam is understanding what the question is asking you. In my course you will learn how to read the national exam biology questions and how to solve all the problems that the exam can throw at you along with a study plan.

	I have spent [five years] teaching national exam classes and tutoring students on the national exam biology. I have practiced hundreds of problems and narrowed down the most common problems on the national exam and the easiest way to solve them. All of my students have improved their scores after tutoring with me and I am going to share my techniques with you in this course.`,
